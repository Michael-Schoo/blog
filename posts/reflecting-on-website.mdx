The week that has passed contained me finishing making a website (so it can be submitted like tomorrow). This was not the easiest of all things as said [last week](/p/w3c-validator) designing an actually good interface is painful. While I did try to do the logic first (JS), I now had to actually had to fix/change my HTML and add lots of styling (CSS). I seem to have added lots of styling because my main/only CSS file is over 1,000 lines long, this could be because for every page I have added it underneath the others, this has lead to code duplication for very similar items but also hard to find the thing that should be changed. The 2 ways to sole this is spreading out the code into multiple files, or keep it the same and add helpful code comments (of which there is minimal of in whole project).

I also had to reflect on my website which included how similar the website was to the wireframe made. Only issue is that I haven’t made it yet (or at least after making the design in code), so the analysis is going to be very small considering it is basically the design. There are a few things that are not going to be in the final version because they looked better in the concept, but when done in the actual website it didn't look/feel right. I also had to identify my target audience, I said just any person that is shopping online as I couldn’t think of anything else to put there, I suppose I could have done a website targeted towards enterprises, but this works. If you aren't getting why I am suddenly doing this now, is because I did the task ignoring the report, and now I am doing the report forewords. This also had to be W3C compliant, currently it is doing some apparently illegal things such as putting some non-text things inside a list element, my opinion of it (of how I don’t like it) still has not changed.

Hypothetically, if I was to restart this week and redo it, I would spend more time implementing features instead of making it look good. This may sound weird as most of the assignment is about the looks rather than how much functionality it has, but for it to feel complete in my mind I want to have as much functionality as possible. To be fair I did spend a bit too much time on making unnecessary features like if someone was to do the [Konomi code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code) sequence the page would be looking very weird. It was part of the things that I think I did well, but I think my pages that run kind of server-like but are 100% static and client side. To elaborate on the product's page you can click onto a product, and it appends a `?id=x` onto the URL, then uses JS to find the product and then show it full screen, and then implement comments using local storage (so stored somewhere). While it does not seem like anything that fancy it took some time, and feels good now that I have done and achieved it (even if it is partially completed). Over the period of making the website I have somewhat made a design that is followed throughout most of the pages (some have the general concept). This was done because of how making one page was frustrating, and then once it was good enough I used that page’s design and added it to the others, some still have a bit too much styling on it (like lots of `:hover` styles) and it needs to be removed. However, I did find once I had successfully fixed the frustrating part, things felt better, and possibly proud.

**TL;DR:** *Basically finished assignment, will submit it* very *soon. Exited for the soon approaching holidays.*
