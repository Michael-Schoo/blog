## Overview

In the last week of web dev we continued learning about frameworks (mainly CSS ones). As said [last week](/p/css-frameworks), I was going to change my website to incorporate the major CSS frameworks. And if we wanted we could start learning about a JS framework called jQuery. These are useful (and sometimes required) if trying to make a good-looking responsive site.

### What was done

I didn’t really change my website that much, that was because after looking at how much styling I had done to make it look how it is. Nevertheless, I did some basic testing of trying to make every component on the page use the framework’s classes instead of the ones I had made. Soon after I gave up trying to change it, it seemed like a waist of time and would be better to craft a site from scratch instead of modifying an existing one.

I decided to look at the jQuery things a little bit (not that much and some skim reading). From what I have read it is basically JS but possibly better, a reason is because it can do some typical things that is in JS but have an easier method in jQuery. From some of the searching I did, it seems to be a legacy JS framework because a lot of the impressive features are cross ported into JS or in better in other JS frameworks such as React.js.

## Reflection

### How did you help others?

I wouldn’t say I helped others much in website development, but in the other ITs (eg robotics) I did help people as much as I could. The reason that I couldn’t help much in web dev was because there are only 2 of us currently doing it, and thus there are not many people that may need help with it. However, as there are a few more in the other streams of y11 IT, I could help their issues/problems to the best of my knowledge (which isn’t that good).

### What are some things you did really well?

Some of the things that I did well was attempting to rewrite my previously made site to be better. However, this didn't last for too long as it got to difficult for the result, while I could have put on the effort to finish that I may not have had any time for the next part. That part was the jQuery one where I was learning about what it can do, I also did the research about it well. There were lots more research that I could have don’t on it, but since I haven't really started it I would say it was good amount.

### What is frustrating you?

Many things frustrated me while completing last week’s tasks. The main one is mentioned throughout this post, and it is how annoying it is to change a sites CSS once it is made. To be fair when I was making the site I could have used a framework instead of making lots of lines of CSS by myself. But it seems like it is easier to start and stick with one CSS method and not change it too aggressively. The other thing that was mildly annoying was how everything that was about jQuery was on an old page making it seem like a legacy piece of software.
