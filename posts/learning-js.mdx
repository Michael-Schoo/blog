The last week has been full of... learning about JS (short for JavaScript - but I hope you already know that), this includes learning about how it can control the webpage (DOM) and other cool things you can do (wait, we haven‚Äôt even learned about that üò¢).

So, this week has not been that much more interesting than last week, but that could be because I haven‚Äôt tried to finish everything quickly. However, the task required was to learn about the DOM and APIs with HTML and XML. The first one (the DOM) is the overarching topic linking all the other abbreviations together, it stands for ‚ÄúDocument Object Model‚Äù. API is short for ‚ÄúApplication Programming Interface‚Äù, and it is a set of functions or methods used to access some functionality. HTML and XML are similar, ‚ÄúHyperText Markup Language‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúExtensible Markup Language‚Äù, they are both a markup language which means it can be useful for representing information from a wide range of applications.

After learning about what can be used (the boring theory stuff), we can finally learn about JS, the best programming language (ok, that was a bit harsh, Python isn‚Äôt that bad). But all we learned about is how to interact (or manipulate) with the DOM and update our pages (don't know how to do, as already did that before this task given...). It is for updating ‚Äúyour own page so that you can build a catalogue of completed work to reference later.‚Äù, but GitHub does that in commits, and I'm not bothered to make new repo, so... .

Overall, nothing much was done, and thus not that much to talk about. However, I believe we are leaning about this, is because every modern website uses JS for lots of things, but primarily modifying the website. This is very useful when a website is needing to be dynamic and do things fancily. The things I did well are, nothing much, well as said earlier I didn't do that much work, but I did read and do the activities on the pages like requested (is the teacher even reading this?). So, I could improve and have better understanding and knowledge on websites (I say that every week tho, and do I actually do that?). My next steps are to finish the task, modify the page and make betterness, and to upload the code and submit it, and then doing the next task. If only they didn't keep coming, I actually don't find them that bad, its more just he time management skills. The most relevant thing involved is websites, they are the topic on the cause, and very useful (you are using one right now!). They are used in everything (from desktop apps - using electron, to using a browser, and more), and that is what I will be doing.

**TL;DR** *I did some work, and learned already known things. Next week better?*
