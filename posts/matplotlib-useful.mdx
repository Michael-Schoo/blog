Apparently, this program (that was learned [last time](/p/learning-matplotlib)) is about plotting data and is useful for representing data in a meaningful way. This not only includes all the graph options, but the level of customization that is found. This includes the ability to change the colour of everything involved, and the line marking styles (that is basically all that was tasked to learn).

Those are just basic examples, but just look at the [documentation][matplotlib-docs], and you can see heaps of customization there. You can change basic things, like the min/max of the graph, or the width of a line. Those on their self isn’t that interesting, but when you're combing all of them it becomes one of the best ways to show data. Since it is just a python library, you could even make more modifications by forking the [repository][matplotlib-github], and changing to your liking. That could be a bit to much of a challenge, but it is worth it if you really want that level of change (could even make a PR if that good).

I wouldn’t think I would say this, but there wasn’t enough tasks (or stuff to do in them), I didn’t really look at them (because of other subject’s assignments), and now looking at them, there isn’t much to write about. I could have talked more about last week, say how good customization is, or just try to write something relevant and ...

The week was as productive as it could be (for other subjects mostly), I completed the task mostly, because I found out about it wild doing the last task. I believe this is being learned, is because the teacher probably wants the graphs (when assignment later) to not look boring, so marking is more interesting. It also would give more interest for me, because it will look better (or I might waist a lot of time tinkering with it), but ultimately it will look better with customization. To be honest, I can't really prove to the teacher that I did work, that is because it is more reading (but later on he will notice if I didn’t do it), and also because I didn’t really do much. This is hopefully going to change, but that depends on my assignments and the tasks given. The activities that worked the best (for learning) were trial and error, and just reading, it is useful because you find out interesting things, and then you have a chance to implement them (and make look good). But it really depends on the task, and how bothered I'm feeling, the latter I will try to improve (as after all it is IT).

**TL;DR** *I did some work, learned that representing data is simple. More things next week...*
