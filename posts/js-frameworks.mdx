## Overview

In case you haven't realised yet, this is another post for the week that just occurred. However, in this week we continued to learn about jQuery and more broadly other frameworks using JS (ok that part was more just because I thought it would be fun). The actual task was to make a site with jQuery and follow the requirements, I did that easily and that is why I did more research on other frameworks.

### What I did in the time

As I didn’t think jQuery was the only thing that web developers can use to maximise JS and make life easier, I decided to look at the other frameworks. These are some examples:

- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) is a rugged, minimal framework for composing JavaScript behaviour in mark-up. This framework is a direct competitor to jQuery and it can make certain things in slightly different ways. This is mostly used with event handling methods, once an event occurs you can do something (run a function).
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) is a modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras. You would want it because it makes JavaScript easier by taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. Lodash’s modular methods are great for: Iterating arrays & strings and Manipulating & testing values and Creating composite functions.
- [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) simply provides syntax highlighting for the web. It can work with pretty much any mark-up, doesn’t depend on any other frameworks, and has automatic language detection. Basically, if you want to show code snippets on the web, this may be for you.
- *And just because…* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility. It is so popular that it has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

When looking for some examples I kept on finding packages that are for node.js via npm. I decided to not look into them that much because CDN library's are easier to use and if using I was to use servers then I would use Python as that is what we would be doing in the class anyway. Obviously, these examples above are not all but just a few notable frameworks that I might use in the future.

## Reflection

### Did you understand the task given?

Yes, I did understand the task of following requirements to make a jQuery powered site very much. It was either how easy it is to use jQuery (or any intuitive framework) or it is because making a site is easy (excluding the designing of it). For the first part where we were given some tutorials to look at, I didn’t really do them and just looked over them. That was because it sounded simple enough and I wasn’t bothered to actually spend that time on it.

### Did you give your best effort on this?

As said just above some parts of the task I didn’t give my best effort to complete. However, to not make the week boarding I tried to make the [website](https://michael-schoo.github.io/tasks/JQuery/JQuery) more complex then it had to be/ make it interesting. I did that by having chaotic functions (the clock every second) and unnecessary loops (the bee movie), it was simple but enough for the fun. If I did put some effort into the tutorials, I may of made a different website but I don’t think it would have made that much of an impact.

### How did you help others?

To help others in class I showed classmates my bad website and the way that I did it (aka code). Its not like if I didn’t do that, they wouldn’t have understood jQuery, rather that they know another perspective on using it. Knowing other people’s ideas can lead to them having inspiration or them actually providing you with ideas to improve your site (but this is not helping others). I also helped others to understand the APIs that jQuery offered, however that was only if and when they asked (I didn’t go around asking if they needed help).
