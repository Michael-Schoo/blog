The last week was basicity the intro to [website development](/p/../categories/web-dev). Because we looked at websites, that were explaining the Internet and the W3C. Even though some of them were old or confusing, there was still some learning that occurred.

We looked at the [Internet White Paper][task-1st-read], and learned about how everything works on the internet. We learned about `ping`, this command effectively tests the quickness of a connection to a server. We also looked at `traceroute`, this command is used to find the path to a server. We then learned about DNS, and what happens when disabled, spoiler alert, lots of websites don't work. Afterwords we looked at `telnet`, and how it can be useful, and how it can download HTTP sites. We also learned about ports, but they are kind of boring compared to the other stuff.

Then we had to answer what the internet was. And I said it was a connection of computers transferring data between another. That was my general answer, but there was a longer one. A vast network that connects computers all over the world, with it people can share information and communicate from anywhere with connection.

After that we read [The Importance of W3C Standards][task-2nd-read]. It was mainly saying that without standards websites will go weird, and that standards are a good way to make sure that the websites you make look the same on every devices.

We then were meant to check out their [Mission Statement][task-3rd-read]. Without having given the link prior it would have been hard to find the page. But the page is saying that they develop protocols and guidelines for the long-term web.

The W3C also has [Accessibility Guidelines][task-4th-read]. It is a not very lengthy (I thought it would be very long) document that describes them-self and how they are useful. But they don't really get in-depth about actual accessibility stuff.

If I could have done this task again/differently, I would have exported more about the internet, but not get sidetracked like I kept on doing (eg when I found a [telnet server](https://telehack.com/)). This would have better as I learn more about the internet without learning/spending time on random stuff that isn't that helpful. I found stratification in that I already knew most of the stuff, but the parts that I didn't know made my knowledge not have as many gaps. The purpose of this task (to my understanding) was to learn more about the internet and how it is run (because that is what the unit is).
