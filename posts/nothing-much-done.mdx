## Overview

Like always, you probably read my web dev first. As such you know that I haven’t really done that much work in the past week… But I have come up with some ideas on what I could possibly do for my ML assignment (where I have to make a computer smart in an area). Even when I do decide on the topic, I may change it as I will have to experiment with how to implement and train (and somewhere I may realise that another idea is better).

### What was completed

I currently don’t have that many ideas on what to do (even considering last week’s list). A thing that I am might be an idea is making a text shortener/expander AI. This could be interesting as it can be fun to test and make examples to use. There can be ethical issues from the data sources used and how this could be used incorrectly or not that good (ie could be for other assignments). If I am feeling fun, I could make an up/down sampler for images. If I like images, I could even do OCR and try and detect words from an image. There are many things that I can a do with text, and even more with images (though it can be harder to test and write code).

## Reflection

### Should you have spent more time last week in IT?

Yes and no… I have prioritized some other classes that I am, so IT wasn’t as important as other times. However, I can’t forget about this class because it is a big assignment, especially considering the last part which is the presentation. As said in the other post (web dev), I need to make sure I structure my time and plan it well (which means not get caught up in unnecessary things - ie name of app…)

### Which issues/ problems can you see to exist?

I can see that ethics and bias can cause issues with this. Alot of the popular things related to AI has questionable ethics, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) has issues with data collection and incorrect data, [DALL·E](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2) has issues also with data collection (the images that are used to train the new images on). I need to make sure I do my assignment in a way that minimises ethical issues, and removes as much bias as possible (ie not liking a certain phrase because it isn't popular).

### How did you help others?

I tried to talk to others (other classmates) to try and get an idea on what they are planning on doing and then I asked them some questions on their method of implementing. This was useful because they may not have thought of potential issues that I was concerned by. They may have realised later on, but I am glad that I made them think about it earlier on. It was helpful for me also; this was because it got me to think about the assignment even thought I haven’t really started it yet.
