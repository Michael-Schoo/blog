## Overview

Even though data science always beats web dev to introducing the last week of events, I will try to tell its side of the week (and btw it has been a whole 7 days since last update). To be honest I have not done much since last week’s update, I have been doing other subject's assignments (including data science). The main thing that was done was working out how to apply SQL into actual things (such as Python). I also did some thinking about what data topic I want this database to be centered about, but I haven’t decided yet (nothing was interesting yet).

### What was completed

I went looking around for data that is easy to download (but doesn’t have all the constraints as another assignment). After all I am making a database to help with a website trying to make an interactive collection site that people can add to and add their reviews (hopefully not toxic). It is just an assignment, so it is not like there is an actual person making it, but to think about an assignment as a real-life scenario always helps. Currently I am thinking about finding a list of songs, some movies, and some books (the main categories that are popular) and each on them I will try to get varying popularity so that some are good, but others are just bad.

Nothing noticeable for the programming side (if you were a stalker looking at its [GitHub](https://github.com/Michael-Schoo/Simple-Database-Design) you would notice). It was more that I was testing and changing the code many times and haven’t committed any of the changes, that is because nothing much has changed as I just was testing [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) and general SQL things that weren’t actually meant for the project.

## Reflection

### How effective was your use of time?

My use of time was not that effective, very few things were actually done. Luckily there still lots of time remaking to start putting in the effort to finish all the required things (in the time that is remaining). I think having so much time to do a somewhat simple task is what is stopping me from doing my best and putting it off because I have other things that I can think is more important. Overall, I do need to fix my time management which would allow for more tasks to be done better.

### Which ideas make the most sense?

The ideas that seemed to make sense were the items that fit perfectly into the database. People would expect books/movies/songs in an all-rounded exhibit, this means that the website doesn’t have to be restricted to one type of content. But if done correctly then they can still make change it to specialise in one specific collection site (e.g. rating new books for children). The other ideas that were logical were that I need to make sure I add all the properties provided (or at least most) because it can help later on.

### What made you curious?

Some could say that finding the data was interesting but learning about databases and how they can be useful outside of school was the thing that made me curious for the week. Afterall, school is about teaching people about things that will help with their adulthood (i.e. jobs). Since storing data will never go away actually making a database that is storing different things can be applied in lots of applications.
