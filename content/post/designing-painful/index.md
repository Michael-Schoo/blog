We have gotten the assignment that I promised last week (and said other post). However, I am not sure how I feel about this specific task, while it is still better than last research one it is doing something basic (and restrictive). But basically it is just to make a basic website with 5 pages, conform to the W3C specs, and have some sort of quiz (that tells a user what product they should get).

When I said restrictive I mean that it has to be 100% static, that means no server aloud (no flask/express), but it also includes no using basic python server (`python -m http.server`), I wanted to have it use a basic server because it meant I could remove `.html` from every link and make it look better. But the teacher wanted it to be simply used on his computer (just unzip and open file)

With that out of the way, I haven’t actually done that much of the task. I have decided on the folder structure (view on [GitHub][github-danko]), and that's basically all. What I need to do is to wireframe the website before coding it (but I am probably going to code first anyway), and then use my lack of design skills to make it a website that looks good. The more basic but important things to do next week are, working out the design (i.e. colors), making the nav bar (and footer), and adding content (lorem ipsom or actual text). I still don't like to design, but when I am given a specific thing to make that is also annoying (I obviously can't make up my mind).

The things that I did well was doing the other [assignment](../getting-data-is-painful), but actually it would be coming up with the basic folder/file layout (I know very basic, but that's all I did). That is something to do in the near future, but apparently it can be an 8hr task (I am going to take longer then that), so I am not that much behind schedule. The strategies that I used /were useful was doing the most fundamental things first, then add/modify things to make that better, and do that recursively for as many times as needed. This approach is good because it makes it seem like I did work when I didn’t really do anything, it also is good for not waiting time doing unnecessary things (or things that may need to be heavy changed). Even with not doing much, the things that I found interesting was finding cool UIs and thinking on adding them (but ultimately adding them in a very basic way). The only way for me to be-able to do this assignment is to take inspiration from others (esp big corps), because they have spent heaps on trying to make it look good and be accessible.

**TL;DR: ***Started assignment, hopefully good enough. Will actually need to do more next week...*
