Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, a search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware.

## But why use Google?
Because it is has *basically* the whole web stored (public sites)

### Why not Bing?<!--(https://bing.com) -->
Simply put, it isn't as big as Google. It doesn't have the same size of data stored of the web.

### How about DuckDuckGo?<!--(https://duckduckgo.com) -->
Well it just uses Bing, but it is more privacy which means that you might not get the same results as it isn;t tracking you to give the best outcome


## The cool *(maybe unknown)* features

### Exact search
By rapping you query in `"`quotation marks`"` it will only show websites that have that exact string in it.

eg. `"Something I really want"`

### Website
By putting `site:` in front of or website url (eg. google.com) it show results that is on that domain or site.

eg. `site:goodwebsite.com`
or `site:*.goodwebsite.com`
or `site:.edu`

### Not include
By putting a `-`minus in front of a word or url it will not show sites that have that text or is that url.

eg. `-"Something I don't want"`
or `-https://badwebsite.com`

### File Type
By putting `filetype:` in front of a file extension (eg .pdf) it will only show urls that are the file type.

eg. `filetype:pdf`

### Other things
You can also find the available options by going to https://www.google.com/advanced_search.

Most of the search engines support these cool features

And you can have a combination of everything 

## Conclusion
You don't really need to use Google but it is the best option for most people. While there are some cool features that each has, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day, just find one you like and use it. ðŸ˜€
