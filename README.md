# Blog

My blog for school

This blog uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for generating and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host. It uses a Hugo theme called [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack).

The theme was originally written for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I converted it to work with Next.js as of commit[@2fb534f](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/tree/aae9cf67db8661e86996f8808baf4f71c472d911).

```bash
# Install Next.js and other dependencies
npm install

# Development
npm run dev

# Build (and deal with ./out yourself)
npm run build

# Make a new post
npm run new-post:build
npm run new-post
```
